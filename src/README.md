The code for each module is kept in their named folders. 
However, there are some modules that are run by an outside loop in python. And there are some that are complete modules in their own right.

## Running Instructions
Run the following command:<br />
`python data_driver.py <no_of_experiment_as_per_description>`<br />

As there were 8 descriptions, the experiments are numbered from 1-8. Memory Access Latency starts from 6. The actual functions are in data_parser.py<br />

Install pip:<br />
`sudo apt-get install python-pip` on Ubuntu<br />

Install statistics python module:<br />
`pip install statistics`<br />


### NOTE: 
There are a lot of hard coded values like Loop Overhead that were gotten from other experiments.
